# MachineLeaningAssignments
These are the assignments I have done as part of my Master's in University at Buffalo for the course "intro to Machine Leaning"

Project 1:

As part of project we had to apply the concepts of Linear and Quadratic Discriminate Analysis, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression on two different 2D datasets. We also had to plot and compare the results of LDA and QDA, also report and plot the results for both the regressions.

Project 2:

This project is based on Neural Networks. The first part of the project was to implement both the forward and backward propogation for a single hidden layer Neural Network with regularization (Æ›) and also use different hyper-parameters (like number of hidden layers and number of nodes in a hidden layer). Using similar functions, we also ran and reported the results for a Deep Neural Network. I have implemented the Deep NN for 3, 5, and 7 layers. We also tried to compare both the accuracy and the training time for each result to better assess how a Neural Network works. We also tried to understand how a Convolutional Neural Network works by reporting the accuracy and training time for different ranges of iterations. For all the above tasks, we have used CelebA Dataset.

Project 3:

This project is based on Support Vector Machines. We have also implemented Logistic Regression to compare how similar it is to Linear Support Vector Machine in terms of accuracy. I have implemented two different kinds of Logistic Regression: Binary and Multi-class Logistic Regression. After this we have used the scikit-learn's SVM kit to see how different settings vary the accuracy. We implemented linear kernel and radial basis (with different settings) to get different accuracies.
